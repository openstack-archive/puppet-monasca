Overview
--------

The monasca module is a part of [OpenStack](https://git.openstack.org), and is meant to assist with the installation and configuration of monasca itself, and its dependent services (mentioned below).

Module Description
------------------

Setup
-----

**What the monasca module affects:**

* monasca, monitoring as a service for OpenStack.
* storm, Apache's distributed realtime computational system.
* kafka, Apache's publish-subscribe messaging system.
* influxdb, a stand-alone open-source distributes time series database.

Implementation
--------------

### monasca

monasca is a combination of Puppet manifest that configures the monasca client and server configuration, as well as monasca's dependent services.

### Types

#### monasca_config

The `monasca_config` provider is a child of the ini_setting provider. It allows one to write an entry in the `/etc/monasca/monasca.conf` file.

```puppet
monasca_config { 'DEFAULT/debug' :
  value => true,
}
```

This will write `debug=true` in the `[DEFAULT]` section.

##### name

Section/setting name to manage from `monasca.conf`

##### value

The value of the setting to be defined.

##### secret

Whether to hide the value from Puppet logs. Defaults to `false`.

##### ensure_absent_val

If value is equal to ensure_absent_val then the resource will behave as if `ensure => absent` was specified. Defaults to `<SERVICE DEFAULT>`

#### agent_config

The `agent_config` provider is a children of the ini_setting provider. It allows one to write an entry in the `/etc/monasca/agent/agent.conf` file.

```puppet
agent_config { 'DEFAULT/verbose' :
  value => true,
}
```

This will write `verbose=true` in the `[DEFAULT]` section.

##### name

Section/setting name to manage from `agent.conf`

##### value

The value of the setting to be defined.

##### secret

Whether to hide the value from Puppet logs. Defaults to `false`.

##### ensure_absent_val

If value is equal to ensure_absent_val then the resource will behave as if `ensure => absent` was specified. Defaults to `<SERVICE DEFAULT>`
