    In this release Ubuntu has moved all projects that supported it to python3
    which means that there will be a lot of changes. The Puppet OpenStack project
    does not test the upgrade path from python2 to python3 packages so there might
    be manual steps required when moving to the python3 packages.

    Ubuntu packages are now using python3, the upgrade path is not tested by
    Puppet OpenStack. Manual steps may be required when upgrading.
